Michal Schulz pracuje na x86-64 version's low-level parts of 
exec.library - the scheduler and interrupt handlers. The bootstrap 
code has changed a lot and he has managed to compile several 
libraries (thanks to the gigantic effort of Henning Kiel, who fixed 
sources for 64-bit compatibility) into separate modules. In other 
words, the 64-bit kernel is about to boot, multitask and start 
the autoinit route of exec.library soon.

If you have installed an ageing nightly build of AROS, please go to 
the download section and grab a new one. There had been lots of 
important bugfixes, and also some nice cosmetic enhancements. 
After our competition, we have got two "official" wallpapers 
installed by default: `"AROS rose" by d980`__ for the desktop, and 
`"AROS"`__ by Wesper for windows.

Pokud plánujete strávit nìkolik dní v Tuscany (Itálie) v záøí 
22. a 23. nezapomeòte nav¹tívit Empoli. V sobotu 
22. v 16:00h bude AROS prezentován
na pøehlídce `Pianeta Amiga 2007`__.

Some other nice applications had been ported on AROS. We've recently 
got MUIbase, a relational database and `Hively Tracker`__, an AHX 
format mod editor. You may find both in the `Archives`__ as usual.
