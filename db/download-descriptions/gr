    will not work on FreeBSD 4.x systems.
i386-linux-system:
    The hosted version for Linux/i386. This is the most
    complete and mature port, which means that you can run
    all included programs and demos with it. This archive
    contains all AROS system binaries compiled from the Subversion
    tree.

    The hosted version for Linux/PowerPC. This archive contains all AROS
    system binaries compiled from the Subversion tree.

    on your preferred machine. You'll need also gcc and the
    binutils configured to produce i386-elf executables.
ppc-all-sdk:
    Set of files and tools to build your own AROS programs
    on your preferred machine. You'll need also gcc and the
    binutils configured to produce ppc-elf executables.
