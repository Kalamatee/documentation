    This manual will guide you through the necessary steps for installing 
    AROS.

    .. Warning:: 
    
        AROS is alpha quality software. This means that it is currently mostly
        fun to play with and cool to develop for. If you came here because you
        thought AROS was a finished, complete and fully usable operating 
        system, you will most likely be dissapointed. AROS isn't there yet, 
        but we're slowly moving in the right direction.

Downloading
===========

AROS is currently under heavy development. The result is that you have to choose
between stability and features. Currently there are two types of binary packages
available for download: snapshots and nightly builds. 

Snapshots are done manually quite infrequently, mostly when there have been
a larger amount of usefull changes done to AROS since the last snapshot and
someone feels motivated to create a new snapshot. In short, there is currently
no regular release schedule. Even though they are made infrequently and that we
try to pick times when AROS is particularly stable, there is no guarantee they
won't contain bug-free or work on your particular machine. That said, we try to
test snapshots on a wider variety of machines, so in practice they should work
relatively well.

Nightly builds are done, as the name implies, automatically every night directly
from the CVS tree and contain the latest code. However, they have not been
tested in any way and can be horrible broken, extremely buggy and may even
destroy your system if you're unlucky. Most of the time though, they work fine.

Please see the `download page`_ for more information on which snapshots and
nightly builds are available and how to download them.


Installation
============

AROS/i386-linux and AROS/i386-freebsd
-------------------------------------

Requirements
""""""""""""

To run AROS/i386-linux or AROS/i386-freebsd you will need the following:

+ A working FreeBSD or Linux installation (doesn't really matter which
  distribution you run, as long as it's relatively recent).
+ A configured and working X server (for example XFree86).

That's it. 


Extracting
""""""""""

Since AROS/i386-linux and AROS/i386-freebsd are hosted flavours of AROS,
installation is simple. Simply get the apropriate archives for your platform
from the `download page`_ and extract them where you want them::

    > tar -vxjf AROS-<version>-i386-<platform>-system.tar.bz2

If you downloaded the contrib archive, you may want to extract it too::

    > tar -vxjf AROS-<version>-i386-all-contrib.tar.bz2


Running
"""""""

After having extracted all files you can launch AROS like this::

    > cd AROS
    > ./aros


.. Note:: 
    
    If you are running XFree86 4.0 or later, you might notice that the windows
    containting AROS screens do not refresh properly (for example when
    a different window passes over them). This is due to the fact that AROS uses
    the "backingstore" functionality of X, which is turned off by default in
    XFree86 4.0 and later. If you are starting X with the ``startx`` command,
    you can enable it again by passing the ``+bs`` option::

        > startx -- +bs

    If you start X by some other means (eg. with XDM), you can instead add the
    following line to the device section of your graphics card in the
    X configuration file (commonly named ``/etc/X11/XF86Config`` or
    ``/etc/X11/XF86Config-4``)::

        Option "backingstore"

    A complete device section might then look like this::

        Section "Device"
            Identifier      "Matrox G450"
            Driver          "mga"
            BusID           "PCI:1:0:0"
            Option          "backingstore"
        EndSection


AROS/i386-pc
------------

.. Note:: 
    
    We currently do not support installation of AROS/i386-pc onto a harddrive
    [#]_, so therefore this chapter will only tell you how to create the
    installation media and boot from it. 


Installation media
""""""""""""""""""

The recommended installation media for AROS/i386-pc is CDROM, since we can fit
the whole system onto a single disk (and also all the contributed software).
This also makes the installation easier, since you don't have to go through
hoops transferring the software on several floppies.

Since nobody currently sells AROS on CDROM (or any other media for that matter),
you will need access to a CD burner to create the installation disk yourself. If
you don't have access to a CD burner, then unfortunately your only option is to
go for the floppies.


CDROM
^^^^^

Writing
'''''''

Simply download the ISO image from the `download page`_ and burn it to a CD
using your favourite CD burning program. 


Booting
'''''''

The easiest way to boot from the AROS installation CD is if you have a computer
that support booting from CDROM. It might require some fiddling in the BIOS
setup to enable booting from CDROM, as it is quite often disabled by default.
Simply insert the CD into the first CDROM drive and reboot the computer. The
boot is fully automatic, and if everything works you should see a nice
screen after a little while. 

If your computer does not support booting directly from CDROM you can create
a boot floppy_ and use it in together with the CDROM. Simply insert both the
boot floppy and the CD into their respective drives and reboot. AROS will start
booting from the floppy, but after the most important things have been loaded
(including the CDROM filesystem handler) it will continue booting from the
CDROM. 


Floppy
^^^^^^

Writing
'''''''

To create the boot floppy, you will need to download the with disk images from
the `download page`_, extract the archive, and write the boot image to a floppy
disk. If you are using a UNIX-like operating system (such as Linux or FreeBSD), 
you can do this with the following command::

    > cd AROS-i386-pc
    > dd if=aros-boot.img of=/dev/fd0

If you are using Windows, you will need to get rawrite_ to write the image to
a floppy. Please see the documentation of rawrite_ for information on how to use
it.


Booting
'''''''

Simply insert the boot floppy into the drive and reboot the computer. The boot
is fully automatic, and if everything works you should see a nice screen after
a while.


Footnotes
=========

.. [#] It *is* actually possible to install AROS/i386-pc onto a harddrive, but
       the procedure is far from being automated and user-friendly and the
       necessary tools are still being heavily developed and might be quite
       buggy. Therefore we officially do not support harddisk installation for
       the moment.
