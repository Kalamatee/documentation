Introduction
============

This is the Amiga Research Operating System User's Guide. It is meant to get 
people used to AROS. It is for *everybody* interested in AROS, as it tries to 
provide information on AROS in different levels of advancedness. I try to cover
everything in depth, but in such a way that you don't need to learn what you 
don't *want* to learn.


Who should read this guide
--------------------------

This guide will help you getting used with AROS. It is written for everybody 
who is interested in AROS. Keep in mind that 
you are actually using software that is BETA and in research. It is currently 
mostly fun to play with and cool to program for and program in. So I expect 
that your interest in AROS is explained by one of these reasons. If you came 
until here because you thought AROS was a Multimedia Internet-Ready Etc. OS, 
well, you might be right, but it is *not finished*, so you need to be patient, 
boy. If you thought AROS was a Grapefruit-Machine or a Free Money Project, you
are entirely in the wrong place.


How you should read this guide
------------------------------

This guide is ordered from "simple" to "advanced". You can start 
reading at any chapter that contains information that is new to you. But maybe 
even more important, you should stop reading at any chapter that contains 
information going beyond your interest. In this way you can learn yourself the 
advanced topics starting from scratch, or you can stop earlier if you think you 
only want to use AROS, and not program it. People with an Amiga background can 
skip the introduction, and start at "Developing for the AROS platform" if they 
never programmed an Amiga before, or go directly to "Developing inside AROS" 
if they already did. So there is a starting point and a stop point for 
everyone.

It is important to realize that this guide is meant for AROS, not Amiga. So 
even if you owned an Amiga for years, you might need to read "Using AROS" too. 
This is not an embarrassment: you will notice that using AROS is very slightly 
different from using AmigaOS. This is because our Workbench is not finished.
At the moment the system mostly works through a AmigaDos shell - replacement (or Cli to older users), although we do have a Workbench and you can navigate disks and launch the applications with it, but file operations is not yet complete. Old Amiga programmers should read "differences with Amiga programming" from chapter 4 to get an overview of the differences. 

Using AROS
==========

AROS-hosted: An Operating System in an Operating System?
-----------------------------------------------------------

AROS is originally developed on Linux_ running on an Intel-based computer. It 
runs on many more machines and Operating Systems, though. This may sound 
strange: an OS running on top of an other OS, that's emulation, right?

A nice term for what AROS-hosted does is "API emulation". API is a three-letter 
acronym for Application Programmer's Interface. In plain English: an API 
provides (C Language) functions that a programmer can use. The AmigaOS API 
consists of a load of library calls that an Amiga programmer can use to make 
an Amiga program. AROS emulates the AmigaOS API: it tries to provide the same 
library calls as AmigaOS. An Amiga emulator, such as UAE_; emulates the Amiga 
*computer*: the processor, the connected hardware, everything. This has its 
advantages, like being able to play binary Amiga games on different hardware, 
and its disadvantages, like not being able to use the emulator as a "real" OS, 
on a "real" processor. AROS-hosted runs on the "real" processor. But it isn't a 
"real" OS, *unless* you run in such a way that it doesn't require Linux. This 
is called "native" AROS.

AROS can run natively on the Intel and Amiga computers, but not quite as good 
as it runs on Linux. AROS library functions are made to run under Linux first, 
internally using Linux kernel and library calls. This way a programmer has got 
the opportunity to bother about the implementation of the whole system first, 
and to bother about the technical details in a later stadium. People are 
currently working on making the "native" AROS more usable. The results are
very impressive and it is perfectly possible to use AROS-native as a real (and only) Operating system on an IBM PC compatible machine.

Of course, AROS is not *only* an API emulator. It also tries to provide replacements to all the AmigaOS3.1 system software, and you will also find a few demos and games being shipped with AROS, just to show that they work - we might just be at 77% of the whole system, but we already have Quake running!


Using "native" AROS on i386 and m68k
------------------------------------

Native AROS is currently under heavy development. If you want to see cool 
tricks, try AROS on Linux. But if you're (also) interested in what a great job 
the programmers have done, you can try "native" too.

The instructions for installing native AROS are varying depending on which 
platform you use. Because "native" is still in great development, the *results*
from installing native AROS can also vary depending on the age of the code that 
you use.

On an Amiga (m68k), you can place the native code somewhere on your harddisk, 
double-click the "boot" icon, do a reset and enjoy a complete Amiga system. 
This is because it is not *really* native. The boot program just temporarily 
replaces a few AmigaOS libraries with AROS libraries. For testing purposes this 
is of course good, but in the end you still run good ol' AmigaOS and not plain 
native AROS. This will change as we build a more complete 68k AROS system. This system is often called AfA (AROS for Amigas).

On i386 there`s a different booting media available. First and most useful binaries set is an AROS LiveCD which you can get in the Downloads section. It is can be either a snapshot or a nightly build (first is more stable but outdated, last has latest changes made but can be unstable in rare cases). Second is the AROS boot floppy, which is intended to boot systems that unable to boot from CD. It`s have a minimal set of features but thus have small size also. If you have no CD drive it still can show some part of an AROS to you.

So, after you download the AROS LiveCD archive unpack it and write ISO image to the CD-R(W). If you intent to use AROS in virtual machine, you can use ISO as-is. Once the disc is ready, you can reboot your PC with the LiveCD. If your system does not support booting from CD, also download and write an AROS boot floppy to disk (with Rawrite or Winimage program, for example) and boot from it, leaving CD in drive. After the CD is booted you will find yourself in AROS (it is looks stunningly close to AmigaOS). You can fool around LiveCD with the Wanderer (or with Shell), play some games/demos included in contributed programs on the CD, look at system basics until you get bored. Also it`s possible to add files to ISO image and get some extra software written for AROS, and rewrite the LiveCD. For now here end simple part of using an AROS-native. To test all other features it`s required to install the system to the hard disk (real or virtual). This process can`t be called easy, and must be treated as experimental. It has beed desribed in Installation Doc. Anyway, remeber that work continues and soon you can get more from native AROS - keep in touch!  


Using AROS hosted on Linux or FreeBSD
-------------------------------------

Once you got the binaries for your system, either by compiling or by 
downloading pre-compiled binaries, you should go down into the 
"bin/$TARGET/AROS" directory, where $TARGET is your system target (something 
like "linux-i386"). Run the file "aros" ("./aros"). The Workbench replacement
"Wanderer" will be started.

There`s some command line options for aros executable that could be used.
You can get this list with ./aros -h option given.
Laters ...

Because "Wanderer" is very limited you'll prefer to work with the Shell. You can
start it from the menu "Wanderer/Shell". Now you should type in commands, and the most 
important command is "dir": it will show you a directory's contents. The 
directory named "C" contains all the commands, so it might be useful to display 
its contents with "dir c:". The shell behaves like an AmigaDOS shell, and the commands in 
"C" behave like their AmigaDOS equivalents. (Note to UNIX folks: to address the parent 
directory, use "/" and not "..": this will look ugly because AROS thinks that 
Linux's ".." is a normal directory. You shouldn't use "./" as a prefix to 
address a command within the current directory either, but leave this away 
instead.) Once you are used to it, try to execute a few programs (especially 
the "Demos" and "Games") to get an impression of AROS capabilities.

AROS Basics
===========

AROS Zune GUI Basics
--------------------

GUI abbreviation stands for Graphical User Interface, and is applied to all the means used by OS to interact with user other than plain command-line interface (CLI). For those who never have used any OS from Amiga branch, it will be useful to give some GUI basics to help them in use of our system. Some of it, however, will be AROS-specific. 

An Amiga systems use definitely and common principles, as you can already note.
First, any menu options of any application`s window isn`t attached to that window - it moved to upper strip, where it can be easily acessed. To do this, select window you`re need, and move mouse pointer to upper side of a screen. Then, if you press right mouse button there, you can see the pull-down menu, representing our application`s options. Yes, it looks like MacOS somehow.
Also you can enable the menu to appear on any place of the screen, where you press left mouse button. To do so ...
For example, if no application window is selected, you can see the Wanderer`s menu then. 

Now, let`s consider our desktop - as you probably already know, it`s called Wanderer. What is this ? Well, Wanderer is an application, just like all others.
In fact, it is an AROS file manager, allowing you to choose and operate files (the functionality isn`t complete yet), launch programs, get some system information, launch CLI (shell window) and other functions. Usually it opens on wide screen and acts like your desktop (icons on this desktiop represents the volumes and disks you can work with). It can be set aside by unselecting Backdrop option, which can be found in Wanderer`s menu (remember paragraph above?). After that a Wanderer becomes just another window you can move, resize
etc. So, you can see it isn`t like a Windows or another system`s desktop, fixed to it`s place. Of course, you can even not use the Wanderer at all and use your preferred file manager (e.g. Directory Opus).

But how do the applications behave then, where will they`re open? There`s a `screen` term - screen is the place where your window is meant to be open. If it`s said that application going to open on Wanderer screen, it will look like it`s usually happens in other OS - your app will appear as window on desktop.
Also window usually can be open on it`s own screen  - it looks like it captures the whole screen. But you can switch the screens with a gadget in top right corner fo the screen (this is also applicable to the windows). So you can switch between Wanderer, Directory Opus and any other apps opening on it`s own screen. This behaviour also comes from Amiga`s history.
                                                  
Well, the time has come to say something about windows itself. Aros window usually has controls to manupalte with it. This control buttons are called 
gadgets (which can be translated as interactive kind of graphical element).
First one in the top left corner of a window allows to close it. Next, in the right part allows to minimise/maximise window. And the last used to put window to front or to back just like we switch sreens. Windows can have no gadgets at all (look at the Kitty demo - it`s doesn`t even have a borders and yet has well-curved shape) or have a different set of them. 

The window`s contents consists from some usual elements could be seen in any GUI - buttons, lists, strings of text, any other kind of gadgets. If application is intended to change any preferences of a system or an application it`s usual shortly called *Pref* and has a set of buttons to operate. Usually this buttons are: TEST (applies all the changes made by Pref but doesn`t save and do not the changes but close the window), SAVE (saves the changes and close the window), USE (applies the changes and close the window, but do not saves them), CANCEL (discard all the changes and close the window).

Also, from Amiga`s history the file placement unit is often called a drawer instead of a folder/directory in other systems, but it`s meaning remains the same. Translate it as a directory if you`re unsure.

Another unknown name you can encounter in AROS is Zune. What`s that ? Zune is 
GUI toolkit developed in replacement and best traditions of MUI (Magic User Interface), widely used on Amiga`s. But is there an application called Zune? 
You can find Zune Pref and it allows you to set settings for Zune-based applications altogether or in particular. For example, to set Zune prefs for Wanderer you can select GUI prefs from it`s menu, or to set Zune prefs for other apps you can use it as the CLI command Zune.

Later...


AROS CLI (Command Line Interface)
---------------------------------

CLI commands abstract and comparision, TAB completion...
Later...

AROS System programs
--------------------

We have mentioned the applications, it`s good to give a description of their
functions. So, there`s a groups of the AROS system applications collected in the separate directories:

    + C - the place for all the system commands
    + Classes - 
    + Devs - where the device-related files (drivers, keymaps) and 
      datatypes are placed  
    + Extras - where all the contributed programs reside
    + Fonts - here you can find all of the system fonts. Any additional fonts 
      must be appended (assigned) to this dir.
    + Libs - where the system libraries are located.
    + Locale - holds catalog files of various AROS apps translations
    + Prefs - has a number of preferences-editing programs
    + S - contains some system launch-time scripts
    + System - the place for some system controls
    + Tools -  the place for some commonly used system apps
    + Utilities - the place for some not-so-commonly used but useful apps

Instead of applications, there`s more permanent running programs called *tasks*.

Later...

Customising the installed AROS
==============================

Setting up the Locale
---------------------

AROS is becoming a really international system this days, being translated to many languages. Translating isn`t very difficult, and number of the AROS translators is still increasing. If unicode support will be implemented it can be translated in every language people use. If you feel you can give AROS to your country, both OS and documentation, do not hesitate to contact us and offer your help.

So about the language. First, depending on fonts used you must set fonts by launching SYS:Prefs/Fonts and designating Fonts to different system text: Icons (used for icons labels), Screen (used on common screen) and System (used in CLI window). If your language uses different set than ISO (for example, cyrillyc CP-1251) there`s *must* be the fonts in correct codepage. Aros currently can use two kinds of fonts - the Amiga bitmap fonts (which can be used directly) and TrueType (via FreeType 2 manager, which still has some issues with non-ISO codepages). Bitmap fonts are in any particular codepage, and TTF can be unicode.

How can you change the AROS locale ? To do this you need to launch a Locale pref in SYS:Prefs. You can see a list of supported locales there and select your preferred ones. On the second page of this Pref you can select the country used (it gives correct currency and date/time format). And the last tab allows you to change timezone to that used in your location. 

After you`ve made changes to fonts reboot the system, and you must be able to see all the translated content.

So now we can read, but can we write also in our language? To do this, you must change the keyboard layout.

Keyboard pref...Also this pref allows to save presets - just like any application it`s got a menu, and you can save your preferences to file with the given name and keep different settings of locales. We can use it later to switch our keyboard layouts.

Later...        

Setting up the Network
----------------------

Later...  

Installing the software
-----------------------   

Is that all the User's Information in this guide?
=================================================

This chapter should have told you how to get, install and use AROS. After 
having tried running every program in the directories C, Demos, Utilities, 
Tools, Games, etc., you might wonder if that is all. Yes, currently that is all 
a "User" can do with AROS! But when any new important user code will be ready, 
it will be added to this guide, of course.

If you think that I have not provided enough information here about compiling, 
installing, Subversion, the shell, etc., it might be good to know that I have
reasons for it. First, there is already much information available, and it
would be unnecessary as well as unfair just to copy that information in this
document. 
Second, we are talking about very particular information. Some of the readers 
might be interested in compiling the source code, others might want to know all 
about the Amiga shell. So to keep this guide readable, I only point to places 
where you can find such information, instead of providing it here. You, the 
reader, can then decide if this is of interest to you.
