Function
~~~~~~~~
::


     ASSIGN creates a reference to a file or directory. The reference
     is a logical device name which makes it very convenient to specify 
     assigned objects using the reference instead of their paths.
     If the NAME and TARGET arguments are given, ASSIGN assigns 
     the given logical name to the specified target. If the NAME given is
     already assigned to a file or directory the new target replaces the
     previous target. 
     A colon must be included after the NAME argument.
     If only the NAME argument is given, any assigns to that NAME are 
     removed. If no arguments whatsoever are given, all logical assigns 
     are listed. 
     


Inputs
~~~~~~
::


     NAME     --  the name that should be assigned to a file or dir
     TARGET --  one or more files or directories to assign the NAME to
     LIST      --  list all assigns made
     EXISTS    --  if NAME is already assigned, set the condition flag to
                       WARN
     DISMOUNT  --  remove the volume or device NAME from the dos list
     DEFER     --  make an ASSIGN to a path or directory that not need to
                          exist at the time of assignment. The first time the NAME
                          is referenced the NAME is bound to the object
      PATH      --  path to assign with a non-binding assign. This mean
                          that the assign is re-evaluated each time a reference
                          to NAME is done. Like for DEFER, the path doesn't have
                          to exist when the ASSIGN command is executed
      ADD       --  don't replace an assign but add another object for a 
                          NAME (multi-assigns)
      REMOVE    --  remove an ASSIGN
      VOLS      --  show assigned volumes if in LIST mode
      DIRS      --  show assigned directories if in LIST mode
      DEVICES   --  show assigned devices if in LIST mode
