We need your help!
==================

There are currently only about 6 active developers on AROS any given week, 
which unfortunately means that progress is quite slow. We simply need more 
developers to help us out! There is a huge number of tasks that are in need 
of a dedicated developer. They range from large projects to small ones, 
from hardware hacking, through high-level system to application programming.
There is basically something for everyone that wishes to contribute, 
regardless of how proficient you are in coding!

For those of you who aren't programmers, there are still plenty of tasks that
you can help with! This includes writing documentation, translating programs 
and documentation to other languages, creating nice graphics and hunt bugs. 
These tasks are just as important as coding!
