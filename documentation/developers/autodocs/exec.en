AbortIO
=======

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 LONG AbortIO(
         struct IORequest * iORequest
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Calls the AbortIO vector of the appropriate device to stop an
     asynchronously started io request before completion. This may
     or may not be done. You still have to do a WaitIO() on the
     iorequest structure.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     iORequest - Pointer to iorequest structure.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Errorcode if the abort request failed, 0 if the abort request went
     well. io_Error will then be set to IOERR_ABORTED.


Example

AddTask
=======

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 APTR AddTask(
         struct Task * task,
         APTR initialPC,
         APTR finalPC
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Add a new task to the system. If the new task has the highest
     priority of all and task switches are allowed it will be started
     immediately.

     You must initialise certain fields, and allocate a stack before
     calling this function. The fields that must be initialised are:
     tc_SPLower, tc_SPUpper, tc_SPReg, and the tc_Node structure.

     If any other fields are initialised to zero, then they will be
     filled in with the system defaults.

     The value of tc_SPReg will be used as the location for the stack
     pointer. You can place any arguments you wish to pass to the Task
     onto the stack before calling AddTask(). However note that you may
     need to consider the stack direction on your processor.

     Memory can be added to the tc_MemEntry list and will be freed when
     the task dies. The new task's registers are set to 0.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     task      - Pointer to task structure.
     initialPC - Entry point for the new task.
     finalPC   - Routine that is called if the initialPC() function
                 returns. A NULL pointer installs the default finalizer.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The address of the new task or NULL if the operation failed.

 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Alerts the user of a serious system problem.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     alertNum - This is a number which contains information about
             the reason for the call.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     This routine may return, if the alert is not a dead-end one.


Example
~~~~~~~
::

     // Dead-End alert: 680x0 Access To Odd Address
     Alert (0x80000003);


Notes
~~~~~
::

     You should not call this routine because it halts the machine,
     displays the message and then may reboot it.

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Allocate a number of memory blocks through a MemList structure.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     entry - The MemList with one MemEntry for each block you want to get


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The allocation was successful if the most significant bit of the
     result is 0. The result then contains a pointer to a copy of
     the MemList structure with the me_Addr fields filled.
     If the most significant bit is set the result contains the type of
     memory that couldn't be allocated.

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Flush the contents of the CPU instruction or data caches. If some

Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     address -   Address to start the operation. This address may be
                 rounded DOWN due to hardware granularity.
     length  -   Length of the memory to flush. This will be rounded
                 up, of $FFFFFFFF to indicate that all addresses
                 should be cleared.
     caches  -   Bit flags to indicate which caches should be cleared

                     CACRF_ClearI    -   Clear the instruction cache
                     CACRF_ClearD    -   Clear the data cache

~~~~~~~~
::

     This function will provide global control of all the processor
     instruction and data caches. It is not possible to have per
     task control.

     The actions undertaken by this function are very CPU dependant,
     however the actions performed will match the specified options
     as close as is possible.

     The commands currently defined in the include file exec/execbase.h
     are closely related to the cache control register of the Motorola
     MC68030 CPU.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     cacheBits   -   The new state of the bits
     cacheMask   -   A mask of the bits you wish to change.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     oldBits     -   The complete value of the cache control bits
                     prior to the call of this function.

     Your requested actions will have been performed. As a side effect
     this function will also cause the caches to be cleared.


Example

::



Notes
~~~~~
::

     On CPU's without a separate instruction and data cache, these will
     be considered as equal.

         ULONG flags
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Do everything necessary to make CPU caches aware that a DMA has
     happened.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     address - Virtual address of memory affected by the DMA
     *length - Number of bytes affected
     flags   - DMA_NoModify    - Indicate that the memory did not change.
               DMA_ReadFromRAM - Indicate that the DMA goes from RAM
                                 to the device. Set this bit in

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 APTR CachePreDMA(
         APTR address,

         ULONG flags
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Do everything necessary to make CPU caches aware that a DMA
     will happen. Virtual memory systems will make it possible
     that your memory is not at one block and not at the address
     you thought. This function gives you all the information
     you need to split the DMA request up and to convert virtual
     to physical addresses.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     address - Virtual address of memory affected by the DMA
     *length - Number of bytes affected
     flags   - DMA_Continue    - This is a call to continue a
                                 request that was broken up.
               DMA_ReadFromRAM - Indicate that the DMA goes from
                                 RAM to the device. Set this bit
                                 in both calls.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The physical address in memory.
     *length contains the number of contiguous bytes in physical
     memory.

Cause
=====

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 void Cause(
         struct Interrupt * softint
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Schedule a software interrupt to occur. If the processor is
     currently running a user task, then the software interrupt will
     prempt the current task and run itself. From a real interrupt, it
     will queue the software interrupt for a later time.

     Software interrupts are useful from hardware interrupts if you
     wish to defer your processing down to a lower level. They can
     also be used in some special cases of device I/O. The timer.device
     and audio.device allow software interrupt driven timing and
     audio output respectively.

     Software interrupts are restricted to 5 different priority levels,
     +32, +16, 0, -16, -32.

     Software interrupts can only be scheduled once.

     The software interrupt is called with the following prototype:

     AROS_UFH3(void, YourIntCode,
         AROS_UFHA(APTR, interruptData, A1),
         AROS_UFHA(APTR, interruptCode, A5),
         AROS_UFHA(struct ExecBase *, SysBase, A6))

     The interruptData is the value of the is_Data field, interruptCode
     is the value of the is_Code field - it is included for historical
     and compatibility reasons. You can ignore the value of interruptCode,
     but you must declare it.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     softint     -   The interrupt you wish to schedule. When setting up
                     you should set the type of the interrupt to either
                     NT_INTERRUPT or NT_UNKNOWN.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The software interrupt will be delivered, or queued for later
     delivery.


Example
~~~~~~~
::



Notes
~~~~~
::

     No bounds checking on the software interrupt priority is done.
     Passing a bad priority to the system can have a strange effect.


Bugs
~~~~
::

     Older versions of the Amiga operating system require that the
     software interrupts preserve the A6 register.

     Software interrupts which are added from a software interrupt of
     lower priority may not be called immediately.

ChildOrphan
===========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 ULONG ChildOrphan(
         APTR tid

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     ChildOrphan() will detach the specified task from the its parent
     task child task tree. This is useful if the parent task will be
     exiting, and no longer needs to be told about child task events.

     Note that the default Task finaliser will orphan any remaining
     children when the task exits. This function can be used if you just
     do not wish to be told about a particular task.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     tid     --  The ID of the task to orphan, or 0 for all tasks. Note
                 that this is NOT the pointer to the task.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Will return 0 on success or CHILD_* on an error.

     The child/children will no longer participate in child task
     actions.

ChildWait
=========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 IPTR ChildWait(
         APTR tid
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Wait for either a specific child task, or any child task to finish.
     If you specify tid = 0, then this call will return when any child
     task exits, otherwise it will not return until the requested task
     finishes.

     Note that the tid is NOT the task control block (ie struct Task *),
     rather it is the value of the ETask et_UniqueID field. Passing in a
     Task pointer will cause your Task to deadlock.

     You must call ChildFree() on the returned task before calling
     ChildWait() again. Ie.

         struct ETask *et;

         et = ChildWait(0);
         ChildFree(et->et_UniqueID);


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     tid -   The UniqueID of a task.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Returns either the ETask structure of the child, or one of the
     CHILD_* values on error.

     This allows you to work out which of the children has exited.


Example
~~~~~~~
::



Notes
~~~~~
::

     Calling ChildWait() on a task that isn't your child will result in
     a deadlock.

FindPort
========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 struct MsgPort * FindPort(
         STRPTR name
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Look for a public messageport by name. This function doesn't
     arbitrate for the port list and must be protected with a Forbid()
     Permit() pair.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     port - Pointer to NUL terminated C string.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Pointer to struct MsgPort or NULL if there is no port of that name.

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Find a task with a given name or get the address of the current task.
     Finding the address of the current task is a very quick function
     call, but finding a special task is a very CPU intensive instruction.
     Note that generally a task may already be gone when this function
     returns.

Forbid
======

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 void Forbid(
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Forbid any further taskswitches until a matching call to Permit().
     Naturally disabling taskswitches means:

     THIS CALL IS DANGEROUS

     Do not use it without thinking very well about it or better
     do not use it at all. Most of the time you can live without
     it by using semaphores or similar.

     Calls to Forbid() nest, i.e. for each call to Forbid() you
     need one call to Permit().


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     None.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The multitasking state will be disabled AFTER this function
     returns to the caller.


Example
~~~~~~~
::

     No you really don't want to use this function.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     This function preserves all registers.

     To prevent deadlocks calling Wait() in forbidden state breaks
     the forbid - thus taskswitches may happen again.


Bugs

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Initialize some library base or other structure depending on the
     information in the init table. The init table consists of
     instructions starting with an action byte followed by more
     information. The instruction byte looks like:

     iisscccc where ii is the instruction code:
                       0 - copy following c+1 elements
                       1 - repeat following element c+1 times
                       2 - take next byte as offset, then copy
                       3 - take the next 3 bytes (in the machine's
                           particular byte ordering) as offset, then
                           copy
                    ss is the element size
                       0 - LONGs
                       1 - WORDs
                       2 - BYTEs
                    cccc is the element count-1

     Instruction bytes must follow the same alignement restrictions as LONGs,
     the following elements are aligned to their particular restrictions.

     A 0 instruction ends the init table.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     initTable - Pointer to init table.
     memory    - Pointer to uninitialized structure.

         BPTR segList
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Allocates memory for the library, builds it and calls the library's
     init vector. Generally this function is for internal use and for
     use by library programmers that don't want to use the automatic
     initialization procedure.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     funcInit   - Either a pointer to an array of function offsets
                  (starts with -1, relative to funcInit) or to an array
                  of absolute function pointers.
     structInit - Pointer to a InitStruct() data region or NULL.
     libInit    - The library's init vector or NULL.
                  The init vector is called with the library address (D0),
                  the segList (A0) and ExecBase (A6) as arguments.
                  If the init fails the init code has to free the base memory
                  and return NULL (the library address for success).
     dataSize   - Size of the library structure including system structures.
                  Must be at least sizeof(struct Library).
     segList    - BCPL pointer to the library segments. Used to free the
                  library later.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The library base address or NULL.


Example

 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Add a new task to the system. If the new task has the highest
     priority of all and task switches are allowed it will be started
     immediately.

     You must initialise certain fields, and allocate a stack before
     calling this function. The fields that must be initialised are:
     tc_SPLower, tc_SPUpper, tc_SPReg, and the tc_Node structure.

     If any other fields are initialised to zero, then they will be
     filled in with the system defaults.

     The value of tc_SPReg will be used as the location for the stack
     pointer. You can place any arguments you wish to pass to the Task
     onto the stack before calling AddTask(). However note that you may
     need to consider the stack direction on your processor.

     Memory can be added to the tc_MemEntry list and will be freed when
     the task dies. The new task's registers are set to 0.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     task      - Pointer to task structure.
     initialPC - Entry point for the new task.
     finalPC   - Routine that is called if the initialPC() function
                 returns. A NULL pointer installs the default finalizer.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The address of the new task or NULL if the operation failed.

     entry        - The MemList with one MemEntry for each block you want to get
     return_entry - Pointer to struct MemList *variable where the address
                    of the MemList allocated by this function will be stored.
     return_flags - Pointer to ULONG variable where upon failure the type of
                    memory that could not be allocated is stored. You may pass
                    NULL here.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     TRUE if the allocation was successful. In this case *return_entry will
     be set to the address of the allocated MemList. *return_flags will be set
     to 0.
     
     FALSE if the allocation failed. In this case *return_entry will be set

     This function takes a list of semaphores and locks all of them at
     once. It is only possible for one task to attempt to lock all the
     semaphores at once (since it uses the ss_MultipleLink field), so
     you will need to protect the entire list (with another semaphore
     perhaps?).

     If somebody attempts to lock more than one semaphore on this list
     with ObtainSemaphore() it is possible for a deadlock to occur due
     to two tasks waiting for a semaphore that the other has obtained.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

Permit
======

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 void Permit(
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     This function will reactivate the task dispatcher after a call
     to Forbid(). Note that calls to Forbid() nest, and for every
     call to Forbid() you need a matching call to Permit().


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     None.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Multitasking will be re-enabled.


Example
~~~~~~~
::

     No you really don't want to use this function.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     This function preserves all registers.

     To prevent deadlocks calling Wait() in forbidden state breaks
     the forbid - thus taskswitches may happen again.


Bugs
~~~~
::

     The only architecture that you can rely on the registers being
     saved is on the Motorola mc68000 family.

Procure
=======

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 ULONG Procure(
         struct SignalSemaphore  * sigSem,
         struct SemaphoreMessage * bidMsg
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Tries to get a lock on a semaphore in an asynchronous manner.
     If the semaphore is not free this function will not wait but
     just post a request to the semaphore. As soon as the semaphore is
     available the bidMsg will return and make you owner of the semaphore.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     sigSem - pointer to semaphore structure
     bidMsg - pointer to a struct SemaphoreMessage. This should lie in
              public or at least shared memory.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Principly none. Don't know. Just ignore it.

PutMsg
======

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 void PutMsg(
         struct MsgPort * port,
         struct Message * message
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Sends a message to a given message port. Messages are not copied
     from one task to another but must lie in shared memory instead.
     Therefore the owner of the message may generally not reuse it before
     it is returned. But this depends on the two tasks sharing the message.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     port    - Pointer to messageport.
     message - Pointer to message.


Result
~~~~~~
::



Example
~~~~~~~
::



Notes
~~~~~
::

     It is legal to send a message from within interrupts.

     Messages may either trigger a signal at the owner of the messageport
     or raise a software interrupt, depending on port->mp_Flags&PF_ACTION.

         APTR PutChData
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     printf-style formatting function with callback hook.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     FormatString - Pointer to the format string with any of the following
                    DataStream formatting options allowed:

                    %[leftalign][minwidth.][maxwidth][size][type]

                    leftalign - '-' means align left. Default: align right.
                    minwidth  - minimum width of field. Defaults to 0.
                    maxwidth  - maximum width of field (for strings only).
                                Defaults to no limit.

                    size      - 'w' means WORD.
                                'l' means LONG.
                                'i' means IPTR.

                                defaults to WORD, if nothing is specified.

                    type      - 'b' BCPL string. A BPTR to a one byte
                                    byte count followed by the characters.
                                'c' single character.
                                'd' signed decimal number.
                                's' C string. NULL terminated.
                                'u' unsigned decimal number.
                                'x' unsigned hexdecimal number.

                    As an AROS extension, the following special options
                    are allowed:

                    %[type]

                    type - 'v' means that the current data in the DataStream is a pointer
                               to a an object of type va_list, as defined in <stdarg.h>.

                               From this point on the data is fetched from the va_list
                               and not from the original DataStream array anymore.

                               If the pointer is NULL, however, then nothing changes
                               and data fetching proceeds as if no %v had been specified
                               at all.

                         - 'V' it's like 'v', but requires an additional parameter which,
                               if non NULL, instructs RawDoFmt to switch to another
                               format string, whose address is the value of the parameter.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Pointer to the rest of the DataStream.

     NOTE: If the format string contains one of the va_list-related options, then
           the result will be the same pointer to the va_list object


Example
~~~~~~~
::

                               to use this option.

     DataStream   - Pointer to a zone of memory containing the data. Data has to be
                    WORD aligned.

     PutChProc    - Callback function. In caseCalled for each character, including
                    the NULL terminator. The fuction is called as follow:

                    AROS_UFC2(void, PutChProc,
                              AROS_UFCA(UBYTE, char,      D0),
                              AROS_UFCA(APTR , PutChData, A3));

     PutChData    - Data propagated to each call of the callback hook.

     Build a sprintf style function:

         static void callback(UBYTE chr __reg(d0), UBYTE **data __reg(a3))
         {
            *(*data)++=chr;
         }

         void my_sprintf(UBYTE *buffer, UBYTE *format, ...)
         {
             RawDoFmt(format, &format+1, &callback, &buffer);
         }

     The above example makes the assumption that arguments are
     all passed on the stack, which is true on some architectures
     but is not on some others. In the general case you should NOT
     use that approach, you should rather use the %v or %V options
     and the standard <stdarg.h> facilities, like this:

         #include <stdarg.h>

         static void callback(UBYTE chr __reg(d0), UBYTE **data __reg(a3))
         {
            *(*data)++=chr;
         }

         void my_sprintf(UBYTE *buffer, UBYTE *format, ...)
         {
             va_list args;
             va_start(args, format);

             APTR raw_args[] = { &args, format };

             RawDoFmt("%V", raw_args, &callback, &buffer);

             va_end(args);
         }


Notes
~~~~~
::

     The field size defaults to words which may be different from the
     default integer size of the compiler.


Bugs
~~~~
::

     PutChData cannot be modified from the callback hook on non-m68k

::

     On native builds, this contains a hack to fix dos.library/ramlib
     attempts to setfunction exec functions. Because of this, a funcOffset
     of more than 32 kB be truncated. This hack will also fix other programs
     only using the lower 16 bits of funcOffset and leaving garbage in the
     upper 16 bits. These programs should be fixed.

 void StackSwap(
         struct StackSwapStruct * sss
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Changes the stack used by a task. The StackSwapStruct will contain
     the value of the old stack such that the stack can be reset to the
     previous version by another call to StackSwap().

     When the stack is swapped, the data on the stack(s) will not be
     altered, so the stack may not be set up for you. It is generally
     required that you replace your stack before exiting from the
     current stack frame (procedure, function call etc.).


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     sss     -   A structure containing the values for the upper, lower
                 and current bounds of the stack you wish to use. The
                 values will be replaced by the current values and you
                 can restore the values later.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The program will be running on a new stack and sss will contain
     the old stack.

     Calling StackSwap() twice consequtively will effectively do
     nothing.


Example

::



Notes
~~~~~
::

     Returning from the function that you call StackSwap() in can have
     unexpected results.

SumLibrary
==========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 void SumLibrary(
         struct Library * library
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Builds the checksum over a given library's jumptable and either puts
     it into the library->lib_Sum field (if the library is marked as changed)
     or compares it with this field and Alert()s at mismatch.


Inputs

SuperState
==========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 APTR SuperState(
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Enter supervisor mode (like Supervisor()), but return on the user
     stack. This will mean that the user stack variables are still there.
     A call to UserState() will end this mode.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     None.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The old supervisor stack. This must be passed to UserState(). If the
     processor was already in supervisor mode, then this function will
     return NULL. In that case do NOT call UserState().


Example
~~~~~~~
::



Notes
~~~~~
::

     This is not a good function to use, it has limited scope, and will
     probably be even less useful in the future.


Bugs
~~~~
::

     You can easily cause your system to cease operating normally.

Supervisor
==========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 ULONG Supervisor(
         ULONG_FUNC userFunction
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Supervisor will allow a short priviledged instruction sequence to
     be called from user mode. This has very few uses, and it is probably
     better to use any system supplied method to do anything.

     The function supplied will be called as if it was a system interrupt,
     notably this means that you must *NOT* make any system calls or
     use any system data structures, and on certain systems you must
     use special methods to leave the code.

     The code will not be passed any parameters.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     userFunc    -   The address of the code you want called in supervisor
                     mode.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The code will be called.


Example
~~~~~~~
::



Notes
~~~~~
::

     This function has completely different effects on different
     processors and architectures.

     Currently defined effects are:

     i386 (under emulation)      None
     m68k (native)               Runs the process in supervisor mode.
                                 The process must end with an RTE
                                 instruction. It should save any
                                 registers which is uses.

     You can very easily make the system unusable with this function.
     In fact it is recommended that you do not use it at all.

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Switch to the next task which wishes to be run. This function has
     a similar effect to calling Dispatch(), however it may be called
     at any time, and will not lose the current task if it is of type
     TS_RUN.

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Release a lock obtained with Procure. This will even work if the
     message is not yet replied - the request will be cancelled and the
     message replied. In any case the ssm_Semaphore field will be set to
     NULL.


Inputs

Wait
====

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 ULONG Wait(
         ULONG signalSet
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Wait until some signals are sent to the current task. If any signal
     of the specified set is already set when entering this function it
     returns immediately. Since almost any event in the OS can send a
     signal to your task if you specify it to do so signals are a very
     powerful mechanism.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     signalSet - The set of signals to wait for.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The set of active signals.


Example
~~~~~~~
::



Notes
~~~~~
::

     Naturally it's not allowed to wait in supervisor mode.

     Calling Wait() breaks an active Disable() or Forbid().

WaitIO
======

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~

Function
~~~~~~~~

     Waits until the I/O request is completed and removes it from the
     reply port. If the message is already done when calling this function
     it doesn't wait but just remove the message.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     iORequest - Pointer to iorequest structure.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Error state of I/O request.

WaitPort
========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~

     Wait until a message arrives at the given port. If there is already
     a message in it this function returns immediately.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     port    - Pointer to messageport.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Pointer to the first message that arrived at the port. The message
     is _not_ removed from the port. GetMsg() does this for you.
