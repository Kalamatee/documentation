:Abstract:  
    This is a roadmap intended to outline the requirements that need to be
    fullfilled before AROS 1.0 can be released. It is *not* meant to force
    developers to work on certain things (since it's not possible in an open
    source project anyway) but should rather be seen as a recommendation
    where we would like people to focus their efforts. Hopefully, this will
    help organize the development effort and make us all work more in the
    same direction.


Ports
-----

For AROS 1.0 to be released, these requirements must be fulfilled by the
i386-pc and i386-linux ports (referred to as "mandatory ports" below).
Other ports are not seen as required for 1.0, to keep the amount of work
down.


Requirements
------------

1.  AmigaOS 3.1 API compatibility, excluding parts which are deemed to be
    non-portable or obsolete and not worth the effort. 
    
    To mark something as obsolete even though it is possible to implement in a
    portable way should require good reasons; for example if it is very rarely
    used by applications and the effort required to implement it is
    substantial.

    Details to follow...


2.  Partial AmigaOS 3.5 and 3.9 API compatibility. We choose the parts that 
    we feel are useful and worthwhile to have, and ditch the rest. 
    
    For example, it seems *very* unlikely that we want ReAction compatibility
    since we have already chosen to standardize on Zune for the GUI toolkit
    (and implementing the ReAction API is not a trivial undertaking). Of
    course, this will have to be discussed properly before a detailed list is
    agreed upon.
    
    Details to follow...    


3.  Completed GUI toolkit. This means Zune must have complete MUI API
    compatability and a finished preferences program.
    
    Details to follow...


4.  Standard applications comparable to those which come with AmigaOS 3.1.
    
    This does *not* mean that we have to have the exact same applications which
    work exactly the same as in AmigaOS, but the functionality available to the
    user should be roughly equivalent.

    Details to follow...

    
5   Sound support, meaning API compatibility and basic applications. There 
    should be at least one driver for each mandatory port. 
    
    Details to follow...
    
    
6.  Networking support. This includes a TCP/IP-stack and some basic
    applications like email and SSH clients, and also a *simple* web browser.
    There should be at least one NIC driver for each mandatory port. 
    
    The requirements on the web browser should not be high, but it should be
    possible to at least browse the web in some way (even if it is only in text
    mode).
    
    Details to follow...
    
    
7.  Self-hosted development environment and SDK for developers. Specifically,
    this includes all software required to build AROS like GCC, GNU binutils,
    GNU make and the rest. It must be possible to compile AROS on AROS. 
    
    The ABI for the supported architectures (only i386 at this point) must be
    finalized before 1.0. Once 1.0 is released, the ABI should be stable for a
    considerable time.
   
    Details to follow...
    
    
8.  Comprehensive documentation for developers. This includes complete reference
    manuals over all libraries, devices, classes and development tools and also
    guides and tutorials to introduce whole subsystems and give an overview.
    Also, a migration/porting guide should be available.
    
    Details to follow...

    
9.  Comprehensive documentation for users. This includes a complete command 
    reference, tutorials and installation-, configuration- and other guides.
    
    Details to follow...


10. Substantial testing and bug hunting complete. The 1.0 release should be
    virtually free of bugs, and be a *very* stable release. We should not have
    the fiascos some open source projects have had with their ".0" releases. 
        
    This will probably require an extended feature freeze, followed by a code
    freeze and several intermediate milestones for user feedback and testing.
    Feature requests are not regarded as bugs, unless it is something required
    (but missed) in the preceding milestones. For example, "we need a movie
    player" does not qualify, but "the text editor should have a 'save' menu
    option" does.
