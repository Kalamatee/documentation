.. Warning::

   This document is not finished! It is highly likely that many parts are
   out-of-date, contain incorrect information or are simply missing 
   altogether. If you want to help rectify this, please contact us.

This manual describes the AROS documentation system. It is intended to be read
by documentation writers as well as developers wishing to extend or tinker with
the system itself. To this end, the manual is split into three parts: a common
introduction to the system, how to use it for writing documentation and lastly
technical notes and specifications. Apart from information about using the
system itself, the second chapter also contains some general guidelines to
follow when writing documentation for AROS.

Writing documentation
---------------------

The documentation format we use is reStructuredText (or ReST for short) as
specified by the `Docutils Project`__. ReST is an easy to read and write,
what-you-see-is-what-you-get, extensible, plaintext markup syntax.

You can describe it as a hybrid between a implicit markup syntax and a explicit
markup syntax, which makes it easy to learn and highly readable while still
being powerful and extensible. The `Introduction to reStructuredText`__ contains
some good points about the goals of the syntax.

Since the format is basically plaintext it is very easy to learn by simply
inspecting existing documentation and using some common sense, but nevertheless
it is recommended to at least quickly read through the `ReStructuredText
Primer`__ before starting to work on AROS documentation. 

For more information about the format, the following documents are recommended
reading:

+ `Quick reStructuredText Reference`__

Databases
=========

There are several small databases, which you can find in the ``db`` directory,
all of which are plain text files but using a couple of slightly different
formats. This is mostly a historical artifact and should perhaps be rectified in
the future, but for now it's easiest to keep them as-is. 


Sizes
-----

The files ``aros.size`` and ``contrib.size`` contain size measurements of the
main AROS and contrib sources in SVN, respectively. The sizes are sampled
periodically and added to these databases, which are then used to generate some
nice graphs.

Each line into three whitespace separated fields: date, size in kB and directory
(in that order). The directory part is basically redundant information and can be
ignored.

.. Note::

    The sizes are sampled using the UNIX "du" program. This means that they
    can be slightly misleading since "du" measures "disk usage" and not "total
    file size", which means that it counts the number of blocks used on the
    filesystem for any particular file and not the amount of data it contains.
    So if there is a file that is 66 bytes long and the block size of the file
    system is 4096 bytes, "du" will report 4096 bytes.

Building
========

Requirements
------------

You will need the following to build the AROS documentation from scratch:

+ Python__ 2.2.1

To build the website you will additionally need:

+ The `Python Imaging Library`__ 1.1.3

__ http://www.python.org/
__ http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/


Setting up
----------

Before you can start building the documentation, there might be some setup
required if the needed version of the Python interpreter is not named "python"
on your system. If it is, you can simply skip this section.

First, copy the default settings::

    % cd AROS/documentation/scripts/config
    % cp defaults user

Next, edit the ``user`` file and make sure that the variables are correct for 
your system. An example configuration file might look like this::

    PYTHON=python

``PYTHON`` indicates the name of the Python interpreter; it may also be an
absolute path if you don't have it in the search path. You might need to set 
it to ``python2`` or ``python2.2`` on some systems. 


Targets
-------

There are currently two targets supported: 

+ ``www`` 
  
  This target generates the AROS website which includes all documentation, the
  news, picture galleries with thumbnails and status information. The
  documentation will integrate nicely with the rest of the site.

+ ``html``
  
  This target generates standalone HTML from the documentation, suitable for
  offline viewing and inclusion into documentation packages. 


Procedure
---------

To build a specific target, simply invoke the build script with the target name
as the first argument. The current directory needs to be the root of the
documentation tree. For example, to build the website do::

    > cd AROS/documentation
    > ./build www

If you want to build the standalone HTML documentation::

    > cd AROS/documentation
    > ./build html

The generated files will be put in ``../bin/documentation/<target-name>``, eg.
``../bin/documentation/www`` for the ``www`` target. Additionally, there is also
a ``clean`` target, which will delete the entire ``../bin/documentation``
directory.

.. Note::
    
    There are currently quite many intermediate files generated in the source
    directories, so you cannot put it on a read-only filesystem. If you have
    checked out the sources from SVN there's no need to worry: the generated
    files are ignored as appropriate.
