Requesters
----------

Requesters are a special kind of windows_. They either confront the user with
some information or request some information. Requesters always interrupt the
user's normal workflow, so they should only be used either to inform him of some
important event or to request an information, without which the application
can't continue to work. This kind of requester is called modal requester.

Examples of informational requesters are requesters that report errors (like
failing to open a file) or about requesters, which show information about the
program, when requested by the user.

Like the name indicates, requesters can also request information from the user,
like a file name (using file-requesters), his name or a simple yes/no decision
("Really quit application?").

Requesters should only pop-up, if an application can't go on without knowing
that the user learned about a certain fact or without getting a certain kind of
information. Therefore, most requesters will block the application. That means
that they will not listen to any input, except that in the requester. An
exception are requesters that are explicitly requested by the user, like most
file-requesters or about-requesters. Normally, these should not block the
application.


Easy Requesters
"""""""""""""""

The so-called easy requesters are simple requesters. They can be used to either
provide an information or to ask for a choice. The number of choices is limited
to 256, but it is generally a bad idea to have more than about five different
choices. You also have to take into account that the width of the screen is
limited.
