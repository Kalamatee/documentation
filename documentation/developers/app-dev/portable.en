    This document will explain how to write software so that it can be compiled
    for different AROS flavours.

Introduction
============

Back in the old days it was easy: both integer and address types had a size of
32 bit and the bytes were ordered in big endian. But because AROS is a portable,
developers have to take care about some things or their source code will not run
on all AROS flavours.


Endianness
==========

Computer architectures differ in the order the bytes of integer values are stored
in memory, i.e. their endianness_. On little endian systems the least significant
byte is stored first, i.e. on systems where a byte has 8 bits the bits 0 to 7 are
stored in address n, 8 to 15 in address n+1, 16 to 23 in n+2 and so on. On big endian
it's the other way round.

Endianess becomes important when you store
binary data to files or try to access hardware like graphics cards etc.

You can query the endianness this way::

    #include <aros/cpu.h>
    ...
    if (AROS_BIG_ENDIAN) {
        Puts("We are big endian.\n");
    } else {
        Puts("We are little endian.\n");
    }


AROS_BIG_ENDIAN is always defined if you include cpu.h. It has a value of 1 on big
endian systems and 0 on little endian systems. This makes it possible to query the
define with both C "if" and preprocessor "#if".

You can find some conversion macros like *AROS_WORD2BE* in the header *aros/macros.h*.
If you need some peek and poke functions with build-in endianness conversion look in
*aros/io.h*.

Data Types
==========

Some notes about the AROS data types which are defined in the header <exec/types.h>:

The fundamental data types have a defined size on both 32 and 64 bit systems:

===========  ============
Type         sizeof(Type)
===========  ============
BYTE, UBYTE       1
WORD, UWORD       2
LONG, ULONG       4
QUAD, UQUAD       8
===========  ============

This is opposed to C types like *int* and *long* which are depending on hardware.

*IPTR* is defined as unsigned integer type which is large enough to store a pointer.
You must use it when you want to store an address in an integer type.
The following source code::

    ...
    ULONG address;
    GetAttr(obj, Gimme_Address, &address);
    ...

has to be translated for AROS to::

    ...
    IPTR address;
    GetAttr(obj, Gimme_Address, &address);
    ...

There are other cases like the argument array of ReadArgs(), the return values
of OM_Get of BOOPSI/Zune classes etc.


Hooks
=====

Hooks are used when a function needs a pointer to a function as argument. They are needed
quite often in Zune user interfaces. There are two ways how you can define them:

Register based::

    #include <utility/hooks.h>
    ...
    static struct Hook myhook;
    ...
    AROS_UFH3S(ULONG, myfunction,
    AROS_UFHA(struct Hook *, h, A0),
    AROS_UFHA(Object *, object, A2),
    AROS_UFHA(APTR, msg, A1))
    {
        AROS_USERFUNC_INIT
        ....
        return retval;
        AROS_USERFUNC_EXIT
    }
    
    int main(void)
    {
        myhook.h_Entry = (HOOKFUNC)myfunction;
	myhook.h_SubEntry = 0;
        ...
        DoMethod(button, MUIM_Notify, MUIA_Pressed, FALSE,
            (IPTR)app, 2, MUIM_CallHook, (IPTR)&myhook);
        ...
    }


Stack based::

    #include <proto/alib.h>
    #include <utility/hooks.h>
    ...
    static struct Hook myhook;
    ...
    static ULONG myfunc(struct Hook *hook, Object *object, APTR msg)
    {
        ...
        return retval;
    }
    
    int main(void)
    {
        myhook.h_Entry = HookEntry;
        myhook.h_SubEntry = (HOOKFUNC)myfunc;
        ...
        DoMethod(button, MUIM_Notify, MUIA_Pressed, FALSE,
            (IPTR)app, 2, MUIM_CallHook, (IPTR)&myhook);
        ...
    }

*HookEntry* is defined in amiga.lib. This function forwards the stack arguments
to registers.


Variadic Structure Parameters
=============================

Messages for BOOPSI methods are defined as structs, e.g.::

    struct MUIP_Application_SetMenuCheck { ULONG MethodID; ULONG MenuID; LONG stat; };

This causes problems when the method is called with the variadic *DoMethod*, because on some
architecutes the parameters are passed on stack, in registers, or even in both.::

    DoMethod(obj, MUIM_Application_SetMenuCheck, 10, 20);

The solution is to prefix all elements in the struct with *STACKED*::

    struct MUIP_Application_SetMenuCheck { STACKED ULONG MethodID; STACKED ULONG MenuID; STACKED LONG stat; };


Include files
=============

Include headers for shared libraries from *proto*, e.g.::

    #include <proto/intuition.h>


Porting from AmigaOS
====================

AmigaOS source code often contains compiler attributes like *__asm* and  *__saveds* to use register
for parameters etc. Sometimes even macros like *ASM* and *SAVEDS* are used to get some platform/compiler independence.

The following macros/attributes can be removed or replaced by empty macros:

+ SAVEDS/__saveds/__geta4
+ ASM/__asm
+ CHIP/__chip
+ STDARGS/__stdargs

VARARGS68K is for variadic functions and has to be defined this way::

    #define VARARG68K __stackparm
