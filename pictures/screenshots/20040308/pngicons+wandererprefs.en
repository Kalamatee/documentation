Adam Chodorowski took the time to build a nice set of PNG icons to show 
this new AROS feature off. You can also see the new Wanderer preference 
program, which right now lets you just change the backgrounds of the 
desktop and directory windows, but will later on allow to customize other 
Wanderer's features. 

Also notice that all fonts are antialiased.
